# Future Ideas
A bunch of ideas of how I could improve/tweak this in the future

### Scripting
- Preprocess lua files to convert Strings into SIDS for events etc

### Events
- Allow delaying execution of events

### Assets
- Create different loaders for each asset type
    - Along those lines, add stuff like getPhysicsComponent to entities from the respective subsystem
